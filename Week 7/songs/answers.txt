If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, their audio aura can be characterized by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability of their top 100 songs. If the average values for energy, valence, and danceability are all high (above 0.75), their audio aura can be described as energetic, happy, and danceable.

However, this method of calculating an audio aura may not be very representative of the listener because it does not take into account the listener's personal preferences or the emotional context in which the songs were listened to. For example, a person may listen to sad songs with low energy and valence because they enjoy the emotional release it provides, but this would not be reflected in the calculation of their audio aura.

A better way of calculating the audio aura would be to use a more personalized approach that takes into account the individual listener's preferences and the emotional context in which they listened to their top songs. This could involve using machine learning algorithms that analyze the listener's listening patterns and identify the emotions associated with the songs they listen to. Another approach could be to have the listener rate the emotional valence and energy of their top songs, which would provide a more accurate reflection of their audio aura.
